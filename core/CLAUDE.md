## ðŸš¨ GOOGLE COLAB TESTING ENVIRONMENT
**This application is designed and optimized specifically for Google Colab testing and execution only.** All development, testing, and deployment activities should be conducted within Google Colab notebooks. The application has been configured with Colab-specific optimizations for file handling, networking, dependencies, and browser automation.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modular Python-based email marketing application with GMass deliverability testing integration and advanced Gmail API authentication.

3. **Authenticate Accounts**:
   - **Quick Auth**: Select credential file â†’ Click "Authenticate" â†’ Email auto-discovered
   - **Per-Account Auth**: Manual email + credential pairing
   - Authentication opens in incognito browser (local) or shows manual flow (Colab)
   - Tokens automatically saved in `gmail_tokens/` with account-credential mapping

4. **Authentication Features**:
   - Real-time authentication status table
   - One-click re-authentication

Each error type includes specific solutions and recovery suggestions with HTML-formatted reports.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Process
1. Upload test account and leads files via web interface
2. Configure subjects, bodies, and attachment settings
3. Run GMass deliverability test to analyze account quality
4. Select high-performing accounts from deliverability results
5. Execute real send with selected accounts
6. Monitor real-time progress and error tracking

### Test Files
Located in `test/` directory:
- `test_distribution.py` - Tests lead distribution algorithms

- Use small lead lists (5-10 emails) for initial testing

### Enhanced Testing Process
1. **Authentication Testing**: 
   - Use `test_gmail_auth.py` and `test_gmail_auth_console.py` to verify Gmail API integration
   - Test multi-credential file support and environment detection
   - Validate incognito browser launching and OAuth callback handling
2. **Sender Name Testing**:

## GMass Integration

### Deliverability Testing Workflow
1. Run GMass test with all accounts
2. Application sends test emails to GMass recipients
3. GMass scraper fetches inbox placement results
4. Accounts are scored based on deliverability metrics
5. Select high-performing accounts for real campaigns

### Scoring System
- Score = Inbox count + (0.6 Ã— Promotions count)
- Accounts with inbox â‰¥ 1 are pre-selected
- Results displayed in interactive table with selection checkboxes
