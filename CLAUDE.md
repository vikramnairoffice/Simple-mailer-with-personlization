# Simple Mailer with Personalized Attachments

## Project Overview

A streamlined Python-based email marketing application focused on personalized email sending with dynamic invoice attachments and Gmail API integration. Features high-performance SMTP with persistent connections (84% performance improvement) and simplified token-based Gmail authentication. This application has been optimized for speed, reliability, and ease of use, removing complex OAuth flows in favor of direct token management.

## üìÅ FILE ORGANIZATION RULES

### Core Directory Structure:
- **Core folder**: Only store essential code files (.py, .js, .html, etc.)
- **Test files**: Store in separate `/test` folder outside core directory  
- **Cache files**: Store outside core folder (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.gradio`, temp files)

### File Placement Guidelines:
- ‚úÖ **Core directory**: Main application code, modules, utilities
- ‚úÖ **Test folder**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data, test utilities
- ‚úÖ **Outside core**: Cache files, temporary files, build artifacts, logs

## Performance Metrics

### SMTP Connection Performance (Latest Optimization)
- **Old Approach**: 15.0 seconds for 10 emails (new connection each time)
- **New Approach**: 2.4 seconds for 10 emails (persistent connection)  
- **Performance Gain**: 84% improvement in bulk email sending
- **Implementation**: Persistent connections with automatic retry and cleanup

### Test Coverage
- **40 comprehensive tests** with 100% passing rate
- **Performance benchmarking** with measurable improvements
- **Connection reliability testing** with failure scenarios
- **UI workflow validation** for all authentication paths

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```python
python core/ui.py
```

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r core/requirements.txt
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
python test/test_persistent_connections.py

# Run token management tests  
python test/test_token_manager.py

# Run integration tests
python test/test_mailer_token_integration.py
python test/test_ui_token_integration.py
```

## Key Configuration

### Authentication Methods
- **Gmail API**: Direct token file upload (simplified from OAuth2)
- **App Password**: Traditional SMTP with app-specific passwords

### Email Modes
- **Leads Distribution**: Splits leads across accounts evenly
- **Broadcast**: All accounts send to same recipients

### Attachment Types
- **Invoice**: Auto-generated personalized invoices
- **Random PDF/Image**: From configured directories

## UI Development Guidelines

### Interface Framework Requirements
- **UI Framework**: MUST use Gradio exclusively for all user interface development
- **No HTML/CSS**: Do not create custom HTML, CSS, or other web technologies
- **No Alternative Frameworks**: Do not use Streamlit, Flask, Django, or any other web frameworks
- **Gradio Components**: Use only Gradio's built-in components (gr.Button, gr.Textbox, gr.File, etc.)
- **Styling**: Use Gradio's theming and built-in styling options only
