## ðŸš¨ GOOGLE COLAB TESTING ENVIRONMENT
**This application is designed and optimized specifically for Google Colab testing and execution only.** All development, testing, and deployment activities should be conducted within Google Colab notebooks. The application has been configured with Colab-specific optimizations for file handling, networking, dependencies, and browser automation.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modular Python-based email marketing application with GMass deliverability testing integration and advanced Gmail API authentication. The application sends personalized emails with dynamic invoice attachments and provides comprehensive deliverability analysis through GMass scraping. It supports multi-threading, real-time progress tracking, and both Gmail API and SMTP protocols with enhanced sender name generation and authentication management.

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```python
# Direct execution:
python ui.py

# Or import and run:
from ui import gradio_ui
gradio_ui().launch()
```

### Required Dependencies
```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install gradio reportlab pymupdf faker playwright

### Gmail API Setup (Enhanced Authentication System)
1. **Create Google Cloud Project**:
   - Enable Gmail API in Google Cloud Console
   - Create OAuth2 credentials (Desktop Application type)
   - Download credential JSON file(s)

2. **Upload Credentials in Application**:
   - Use the new Gmail authentication interface in the web UI
   - Upload multiple credential JSON files if needed
   - Each project can have separate credentials

3. **Authenticate Accounts**:
   - **Quick Auth**: Select credential file â†’ Click "Authenticate" â†’ Email auto-discovered
   - **Per-Account Auth**: Manual email + credential pairing
   - Authentication opens in incognito browser (local) or shows manual flow (Colab)
   - Tokens automatically saved in `gmail_tokens/` with account-credential mapping

4. **Authentication Features**:
   - Real-time authentication status table
   - One-click re-authentication
   - Multiple credential support per account
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Environment detection (Colab vs Local)

## Key Configuration

### Email Account Format
Accounts file should contain: `email@domain.com,password` (one per line)

### Leads File Format  
One email address per line

### Attachment Directories
- `pdfs/` - PDF files for random attachment selection
- `images/` - JPG/PNG files for random attachment selection  
- `generated_invoices/` - Auto-generated personalized invoices

### Operating Modes
1. **Leads Distribution Mode**: Splits leads across accounts evenly
2. **GMass Broadcast Mode**: All accounts send to same recipient list

### Default Settings
- Send delay: 4.5 seconds between emails
- Invoice generation: Personalized with recipient email as account name
- Attachment format: PDF, PNG, or HEIC (135 DPI for images)
- Multi-threading: One worker thread per account
- Gmail API: Enhanced OAuth2 system with multi-credential support
- Sender names: Configurable business/personal name generation
- Authentication: Automatic incognito browser launching

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error classification:
- Authentication failures (wrong passwords, app passwords needed)
- Rate limiting and quota issues
- Account suspensions and blocks
- SMTP connection problems
- Gmail API errors and token issues
- Invalid recipients
- Worker thread errors
- GMass scraping failures

Each error type includes specific solutions and recovery suggestions with HTML-formatted reports.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Process
1. Upload test account and leads files via web interface
2. Configure subjects, bodies, and attachment settings
3. Run GMass deliverability test to analyze account quality
4. Select high-performing accounts from deliverability results
5. Execute real send with selected accounts
6. Monitor real-time progress and error tracking

### Test Files
Located in `test/` directory:
- `test_distribution.py` - Tests lead distribution algorithms
- `test_gmail_auth.py` - Tests Gmail authentication functionality  
- `test_gmail_auth_console.py` - Console-based Gmail auth testing
- `test_sender_names.py` - Tests sender name generation
- `test_cleanup.py` - Cleanup and maintenance testing
- Use small lead lists (5-10 emails) for initial testing

### Enhanced Testing Process
1. **Authentication Testing**: Use test files to verify Gmail API integration
2. **Sender Name Testing**: Validate business/personal name generation
3. **Distribution Testing**: Verify equal lead distribution with caps
4. **GMass Integration**: Test deliverability scoring and account selection

## GMass Integration

### Deliverability Testing Workflow
1. Run GMass test with all accounts
2. Application sends test emails to GMass recipients
3. GMass scraper fetches inbox placement results
4. Accounts are scored based on deliverability metrics
5. Select high-performing accounts for real campaigns

### Scoring System
- Score = Inbox count + (0.6 Ã— Promotions count)
- Accounts with inbox â‰¥ 1 are pre-selected
- Results displayed in interactive table with selection checkboxes

- **Automatic token refresh**: Secure token lifecycle management
- **Environment-specific flows**: Different auth flows for Colab vs Local environments

### Email Security
- **Sender name randomization**: Reduces detection patterns
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays to prevent spam classification
- **Error categorization**: Proper handling of authentication and delivery failures
- **Attachment randomization**: Random PDF/image selection for variety
